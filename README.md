# 💻 SQL Injection & Exploitation Demo

This project demonstrates a basic exploitation workflow using Metasploit, focusing on SQL injection vulnerabilities, backdoor creation, and HTML manipulation. It was completed as part of a cybersecurity lab exercise to explore offensive security techniques and understand post-exploitation tactics.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Identify and exploit a vulnerable web application
- Use Metasploit to generate and deploy a backdoor payload
- Modify HTML content to simulate defacement or data exfiltration
- Document the attack chain and mitigation strategies

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Metasploit Framework** – for payload generation and exploitation  
- **Kali Linux** – attacker machine  
- **HTML/CSS** – for simulating post-exploitation changes
